# Pig Game

Pig game implemented with Javascript (learned about manipulating DOM, event listeners, modern JS features), HTML and CSS while doing [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

## Game Rules

- The game has 2 players, played in rounds
- Players choose a winning score and press New Game (default - 100)
- Every round, a player rolls dices as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- If a player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach winning points on GLOBAL score wins the game
